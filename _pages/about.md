Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of [Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/). I obtained a BSc degree in Data Science and Technology (DSCT) with a double major in Computer Science from the School of Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). 

During my undergraduate years, I worked with Prof. [Raymond Chi-Wing WONG](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/) in Data Mining; Prof. [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://www.mrinmaya.io/) in Natural Language Processing (NLP); Prof. [Chi-Keung TANG](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~cktang/bio.html) and Prof. [Yu-Wing TAI](https://yuwingtai.github.io/) in Computer Vision; Prof. [Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/) in NLP.

My ultimate research goal is to make machine learning systems have compatible abilities with humans (of course, everybody wants that); in specific, my research pathway can be formulated as the [X2Y system](https://x.com/RickyRDWang/status/1736426770734502090); currently, I am focusing on how to use formal language like Lean to formulate underlying logic of natural language generation.
